# Dotnet Razor Example Project

This is just a simple auto-generated example project for simulating a front-end developer coming onto a brown field project and being tasked with adding new features and content.

## Running

Use `dotnet watch run` to run and hot-reload any changes.

## wwwroot/lib/

For ease of set-up, this project includes wwwroot/lib committed to the repo. Ideally, this should be managed through something like libman.
